# HardCodedClassifier

The HardCodedClassifier uses the Iris data set and classifies everything
as setosa. 

In the current state, the iris dataset is imported from sklearn, but 
functionality is built in to read the iris dataset from a .csv file as
well. 

Also, a naive bayes classifier is included and can be used by uncommenting
the specified line of code and commenting out the HardCodedClassifier.
